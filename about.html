<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Khoa Le. I am majoring in Computer Science and this is my third year in community college.
  I will go to university in the next academic year. Before I begin my junior year, I am looking forward
  to learn web development skills to create my own website for future uses. And I think it also benefits 
  me when going for an interview.
